/** 
 *  My solution for Project Euler Problem 6.
 *
 *  Sum square difference
 *  The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
 *  12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
 *  The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
 *  (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
 *  Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten
 *  natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
 *  Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one 
 *  hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
