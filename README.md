# About this repository 
This is a collection of problems from Project Euler with implementation in Java or Python 3.

# Project Euler
Project Euler is a collection of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. It is possible to solve each problem with brute force, however, the essense of the challenge is to come out with effective sollution for the problems.

The problems can be found from https://projecteuler.net/archives.
